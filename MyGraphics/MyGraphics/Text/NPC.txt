Ah, you've finally woken up!
Your ship has crashed but fret not!
My home planet is full of tin ore 
for you to use to repair your ship!
Of course we would have to locate it too.
Legend speaks of a sword that resides 
from where the sun rises. 
Perhaps that might be of use to you 
in your adventures.
If it helps, my house faces the north.
Would you like to repair your ship?
Cost: 2 Ores
You need more ores.
Repair successful
Now that your ship has been repaired,
perhaps you might want to gather more 
ore so that your ship would fare better 
out there in space?
I have words with you.
I need to ask you for a favour. 
I need your help to get me to my home planet. 
It's the neighbouring planet. 
I have no ship of my own to fly there.
Do you want to travel to other planet?
